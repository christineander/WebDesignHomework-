    <h1>Lyric</h1>

    <p> [The Treblemakers]<br />
        Oh Mickey you’re so fine<br />
        You’re so fine you blow my mind<br />
        Hey Mickey (hey, hey)<br />
        Hey Mickey (hey, hey)<br />
        Oh Mickey you’re so...<br />
        </p>
        <p>[The BU Harmonics]<br />
        You’re so fine, and you’re mine<br />
        I’ll be yours, till the end of time<br />
        Cause you make me feel<br />
        Yeah you make me feel<br />
        So shiny and new (oh yeah, yeah)<br />
        Like a virgin (like a virgin)<br />
        Touched for the very first time<br />
        Like..<br />
        </p>
        <p> [The Barden Bellas]<br />
            Like the one in me, that’s okay<br />
            Let’s see how you do it<br />
            Put up your dukes<br />
            Let’s set down to it<br />
            Hit me with your best shot<br />
            Why don’t you hit me with your best shot<br />
            Hit me with your best shot<br />
            Fire away<br />
        </p>
        <p> [The Barden Bellas]<br />
            Na na na come on<br />
            Na na na na na come on, come on, come on<br />
            ‘Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it<br />
            Sex in the air I don’t care I love the smell of it<br />
            Sticks and stones may break my bones<br />
            But chains and whips excite me<br />
            ‘Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it..<br />
            </p>
            <p>[The Treblemakers]<br />
                Sex baby, let’s talk about you and me<br />
                Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be<br />
                Let’s talk about sex (alright)<br />
                Let’s talk about sex (a little bit, a little bit)<br />
                Let’s talk about sex baby..<br />
            </p>
            <p> [The Barden Bellas]<br />
                Baby all through the night I’ll make love to you<br />
                Like you want me to and I..<br />
            </p>
            <p> [The Treblemakers]<br />
                And I guess that’s just the woman in you<br />
                That brings out the man in me<br />
                I know I can’t help myself<br />
                You’re all in the world to me<br />
                It feels like the first time<br />
                It feels like the very first time<br />
                It feels like the first time..<br />
            </p>
            <p>[The Barden Bellas]<br />
                It's going down, fade to blackstreet<br />
                The homies got rb, collab' creations<br />
                Bump like acne, no doubt<br />
                I put it down, never slouch<br />
                As long as my credit can vouch<br />
                A dog couldn't catch me straight up<br />
                Tell me who can stop when dre makin' moves<br />
                Attracting honeys like a magnet<br />
                Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent<br />
                Still moving this flavor<br />
                With the homies blackstreet and teddy<br />
                The original rump shakers<br />
                
                Shorty get down, good lord<br />
                Baby got 'em up open all over town<br />
                Strictly biz, she don't play around<br />
                Cover much ground, got game by the pound<br />
                Getting paid is her forte<br />
                Each and every day, true player way<br />
                I can't get her out of my mind<br />
                I think about the girl all the time<br />
                
                I like the way you work it<br />
                (no diggity)<br />
                I gotta bag it up baby<br />
                I like the way you work it<br />
                (no diggity)<br />
                I gotta bag it up baby<br />
                I like the way you work it<br />
                (No diggity)<br />
                I gotta bag it up babe<br />
                I like the way you work it<br />
                (No diggity) (oh that girl looks good)<br />
                I gotta bag it up<br />
                I like the way you work it<br />
                (No diggity)<br />
                I gotta bag it up babe<br />
                I like the way you work it<br />
                (No diggity)<br />
                I gotta bag it up<br />
                Weeow<br />
