    <h1>Surf by Mac Miller</h1>
    <h2> BY: Mac Miller</h2>
    <div class="liyics">
       >"Yeah, yeah, surf <br />
        Hey, hey, hey <br />
        Hey, hey, hey <br />
        Hey, hey, hey <br />
        Hey, hey <br />
        Said where are you goin'? Can I come too? <br />
        The whole world is open, a playground for me and you <br />
        And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows? <br />
        It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose <br />
        Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes <br />
        I dream of this moment, will it come true? <br />
        The whole world, they know it, they just waiting for me and you <br />
        And she, just like I, got her head in the clouds <br />
        Don't need to be lower, before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out <br />
        I ain't comin' down, why would I need to? <br />
        So much of this world is above us, baby <br />
        They might tell you that I went crazy <br />
        I'm just tryna read you <br />
        Ooh <br />
        Ooh, ooh <br />
        I know we try <br />
        And the days, they go by <br />
        Until we get old <br />
        There's water in the flowers, let's grow <br />
        People, they lie <br />
        But hey, so do I <br />
        Until it gets old <br />
        There's water in the flowers, let's grow <br />
        Let it go, let it be <br />
        We're all we need today <br />
        Let it go, let it be <br />
        Mm, mm, mm, mm <br />
        Yeah, well, sometimes I get lonely, not when I'm alone <br />
        But it's more when I'm standin' in crowds that I'm feelin' the most on my own <br />
        And I know that somebody knows me, I know somewhere there's home <br />
        I'm starting to see that all I have to do is get up and go <br />
        Goin', goin', goin', before I'm gone <br />
        Gotta get goin', goin', goin', before I'm gone <br />
        Hey, and I know we try <br />
        Days, they go by <br />
        Until we get old <br />
        There's water in the flowers, let's grow <br />
        People, they lie <br />
        But hey, so do I <br />
        Until it gets old <br />
        There's water in the flowers, let's grow" <br />
